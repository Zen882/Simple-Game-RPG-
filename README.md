This is a game RPG pogram that I made using C language for portfolio basic algorithm. i'm not into C actually but this is the best for practice

Game RPG is a Role-Playing Game where you can choose and build the character as your wish.

In this game you can choose your classes such as Archer, Warrior, or Wizard which have different attribute such as Max Health point and Attack Point.

You can fight monster. there are three monster Goblin, Orc, and, Dragon. if you beat the monster you will gain Exp and Gold. even you can run from fight

You can purchase a Health Potion for increasing your Health Poin which gives you 50 Health Point.

you can buy a weapon to increase your attack point or damage point. you can equip and sell it in your inventory

you can use skill while in the fight and you can upgrade your skill to level 5. skill has cooldown you can keep choose Fight while fight monster to decreased the cooldown.

if you upgrade the skill the cooldown and damage skill will increase.

also if you level up monster health poin and attack point is increase by 50 for health and attack point increase by 10 every player level up.

if you lose a from battle your attributes will be reset.

the last thing you can save your account and load your account.

I give this player gold pretty much to testing buy a weapon, sell it, and upgrade skill
